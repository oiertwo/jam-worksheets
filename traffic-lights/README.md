# Traffic Lights

## Variations

- [Python](traffic-lights-python.md)
    - [PDF version](pdf/Controlling-a-traffic-lights-sequence-with-GPIO-Zero.pdf)
- [Scratch 1.4](traffic-lights-scratch1.md)
    - [PDF version](pdf/Controlling-a-traffic-lights-sequence-with-Scratch-1.pdf)
- [Scratch 2](traffic-lights-scratch2.md)
    - [PDF version](pdf/Controlling-a-traffic-lights-sequence-with-Scratch-2.pdf)
- [EduBlocks](traffic-lights-edublocks.md)
    - [PDF version](pdf/Controlling-a-traffic-lights-sequence-with-EduBlocks.pdf)

## What you will need

- Traffic lights kit (e.g. pi-stop) OR:
    - breadboard
    - 3 x LEDs (green, yellow and red)
    - 3 x resistors
    - 4 x male-to-female jumper wires

## Preparation

If you have pi-stops, no preparation is required - just hand out pi-stops, and port labels if you have them.

If using LEDs and a breadboard, you may want to wire this up before starting, or give them a diagram to wire it up themselves.

If using the EduBlocks version, you'll need to install EduBlocks:

```bash
curl -sSL get.edublocks.org | bash
```

## Notes

- Be careful with capitalisation in Python!
- Check the correct pin numbers are used
- Use different GPIO pins if required
- Use a port label if you have one available:
    - Buy one from http://rasp.io/portsplus/
    - Print your own from https://github.com/splitbrain/rpibplusleaf
- You could continue to [traffic lights full version](../traffic-lights-full/README.md) including button and buzzer
